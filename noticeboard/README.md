# noticeboard

A serverless talking noticeboard.

## Getting Started

First set the `NOTICES_DIR` environment variable to the path of your notices, then run the program.

Your notices should be in subdirectories of the directory stored in `NOTICES_DIR`. Each subdirectory should have at least a text file with a `.txt` extension. Optionally, it can also have a sound file of type `.wav`, `.mp3`, or `.ogg`.
